# BMAD: AI-Driven Development

## What is BMAD?

**B**reakthrough **M**ethod of **A**gile **D**evelopment

A structured methodology that leverages AI agents to accelerate the entire software development lifecycle - from idea to working code.

## The Problem BMAD Solves

| Traditional Approach | BMAD Approach |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Vague requirements → rework | Structured discovery → clarity |
| Documentation debt | Living docs generated as you go |
| Context lost between phases | AI maintains full context |
| "Just start coding" → tech debt | Architecture-first → solid foundation |

## Key Concepts

### 1. Specialized AI Agents
Each phase has dedicated agents with domain expertise:
- **Analyst** - Requirements & discovery
- **Architect** - Technical decisions
- **PM** - Story creation
- **Dev** - Implementation

### 2. Structured Artifacts
Every phase produces clear deliverables:
- Product Brief → PRD → Architecture Doc → Epics & Stories → Code

### 3. Context Continuity
AI maintains full project context across all phases - no information loss.

## Today's Demo

**Goal:** Go from idea to working MVP in 45 minutes

| Phase | What You'll See |
|-------|-----------------|
| Discovery | AI asks smart questions to understand the problem |
| PRD | Requirements document generated from conversation |
| Architecture | Tech stack & structure decisions |
| Stories | Implementation tasks broken down |
| Code | Working feature delivered |
